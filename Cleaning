Google Sheets:

1. Fixing and formatting date columns in the dog profiles table
  * separated dates from “published_at” “status_changed_at” into columns for month, day, and year
  * concated those and formatted into dates
  * deleted original columns

2. Separating tags in the tags table
  * used concatenate function to create a tags column
    ex. =CONCATENATE(B656,", ",C656,", ",D656,", ",E656,", ",F656)
  * used conditional formatting to highlight the dog profiles that have tags
  * used countif to validate the number of dogs with tags and the new tags column
  
3. made state column in the dog profiles table
  * states are identified as the first 2 letters in the organization_id
  * =LEFT(C3,2)

4. made ‘primary_breed’, ‘secondary_breed’, and ‘mixed’ columns from the original ‘breed’ column in the dog profiles table
  * used the ‘split text to column’ function with " , " as the delimiter

5. made ‘primary_color’, ‘secondary_color’, and ‘tertiary_color’ columns from the original ‘colors’ column in the dog profiles table
  * used the ‘split text to column’ function with " , " as the delimiter

6. split up the ‘attributes’ column in the dog profiles table into 5 separate boolean columns
  * used =IF(COUNTIF(J3,"*spayed_neutered': 'False'*"),"False","True") to take the messy data in the ‘attributes’ column into the 5 new separate columns
  * split tags by using split to text and “ ' “ as the delimiter
  * new columns
    - spayed_neutered
    - house_trained
    - declawed
    - special_needs
    - shots_current

Validation in Google Sheets:

1. used filters on age, gender, size and coat to make sure those entries were correct and not mispelled etc.

2. made sure mixed breed dogs were marked as ‘TRUE’ in the mixed column
  * used formula
    =IF(COUNTIF(F2, "<>*None*") + COUNTIF(E2, "*Mixed Breed*"), "TRUE", "FALSE")


BigQuery:

1. Creating a new dog_profiles table with an adoption time column and removing irrelevant columns from the original table

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS dog-adoption-411418.adoption.dog_profiles AS 
  (SELECT 
    id,
    name,
    age,
    gender,
    size,
    state,
    status,
    DATE_DIFF(status_changed_at,published_at,day) adoption_time,
    status_changed_at,
    published_at,
    organization_id,
    spayed_neutered,
    house_trained,
    declawed,
    shots_current,
    special_needs,
    coat,
    primary_breed,
    secondary_breed,
    mixed,
    primary_color,
    secondary_color,
    tertiary_color
FROM `dog-adoption-411418.adoption.profiles`)

Validation in BigQuery

1. confirming all dog profiles are unique and there are no duplicates

SELECT
 COUNT(id),
 COUNT(DISTINCT id)
FROM dog_profiles
